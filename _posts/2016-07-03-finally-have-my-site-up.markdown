After flailing around with my dev environment (uninstalling/deleting/reinstalling homebrew, reinstalling ruby with rbenv, etc), I finally have my Jekyll site ready. Since I'm focusing on learning Python for data analytics I decided to keep myself from getting distracted by learning CSS & JavaScript, so I used the [Jekyll-Uno](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno) theme as it fits my taste the most for the time being~
